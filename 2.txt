Jenkins is an open-source automation server that allows developers to build, test, and deploy their software projects. 
It is used to automate the build process and to manage the software development life cycle. 
Jenkins integrates with many tools and technologies, including Java, to provide a seamless build and deployment process.
To build a Java program through Jenkins, we need to create a Jenkins job that pulls the source code from a Git repository, compiles the code, and runs the program. Jenkins provides an interface for configuring the job, setting up the build environment, and running the build process.

Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and Jenkins on your machine.
Open Jenkins in your web browser and create a new job.
Select "Freestyle project" and configure the job settings, including the source code management and build environment.
Add a build step to execute shell commands.
Enter the commands to compile and run the Java program.
Save the job configuration and run the build.
Check the console output for any errors or issues.
