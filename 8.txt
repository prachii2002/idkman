Docker is a platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. 
Containers are isolated environments that bundle an application with all its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different systems. 
Docker uses images to package applications and their dependencies into portable units that can be shared and deployed across different environments.

To work with Docker, developers need to have Docker installed on their system. 
Docker commands can be executed from the command line interface, allowing developers to interact with Docker and perform various tasks 
such as pulling images, creating containers, and pushing images to registries such as Dockerhub.
