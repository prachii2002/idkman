Docker is a platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. 
Containers are isolated environments that bundle an application with all its dependencies, 
allowing it to run consistently across different systems. Docker uses images to package applications 
and their dependencies into portable units that can be shared and deployed across different environments.

To create a Docker image of a PHP project, we need to create a Dockerfile that specifies 
the necessary dependencies and commands to build the image. The Dockerfile contains instructions 
to build the image, including the base image, any additional dependencies, and the commands to run the application.

Once the Dockerfile is created, we can use the Docker build command to build the image and the Docker 
push command to push the image to a Dockerhub repository.
