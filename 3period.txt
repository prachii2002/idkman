//theory:
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves building and testing software changes automatically and continuously. 
CI helps to identify and fix errors early in the development process, which reduces the overall development time and cost.

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that supports continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. 
Jenkins can be configured to pull the source code from a Git repository, build the code, run tests, and deploy the application automatically.

To set up a continuous integration process for a Java program in Jenkins, we need to create a Jenkins job that pulls the source code from a GitHub repository, builds the program, and runs tests every 2 minutes. 
Jenkins provides several plugins and features to automate the build and test process.
